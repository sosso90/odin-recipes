    <li>If roasting: Place the potatoes on a baking tray (sheet pan) and drizzle 2 tbsp olive oil, season with salt and pepper, mix well so they are all evenly coated with oil. Separate them so they are not touching and roast in oven for 40 minutes at 400°F – 200°C.</li>
    <li>If deep frying (The Lebanese authentic way) this will be faster, place in a deep frying basket and fry until golden brown and fork tender inside. Give them a shake outside the oil every minute or so for even cooking.</li>
